This will provide an estimate of the change in your property tax payments based upon your
home's value.  It starts with the average home value in Montclair, <span id="avgHomeValue"></span>,
but you can enter your own value.  It provides the estimated first year increase and estimated average 
increase over the lifetime of the bonds.  These are subject change as they are based upon estimates of
the interest rate at the time of the bond sale as well as the amount of the individual sales which are
dependent upon the scheduling of various projects which must be fit within the academic schedule as
well as the schedules of vendors and suppliers of materials.
<P>
Note that this does not (yet) account for any of the savings expected to result from this much-needed and 
long-delayed investment (eg. reduced energy costs, reduced maintenance costs, etc.).
<P>
For a home assessed at 
<Input Type="number" id="myHomeValue" value="0">
(<button id="dowork">Compute</button>), the expected increase for the first year is 
<span id="firstYearIncrease"></span>
and the average increase over the lifetime of the bonds is
<span id="averageYearlyIncrease"></span>.
